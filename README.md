# Shadowgrams

## Overview
**Shadowgrams** is an innovative project that leverages **3D facial scans** and **Blender** to create standardized and repeatable shadowgrams. This method utilizes advanced illuminant and camera simulations within the app to provide plastic surgeons with a reliable tool for preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation.

## Features
- **Standardized Shadowgrams**: Consistent and repeatable shadowgrams for accurate assessments.
- **3D Facial Scans**: High-resolution scans to capture detailed facial features.
- **Blender Integration**: Utilizes Blender for simulations and protocol automation.
- **Manual and Automated Protocols**: Guides for manual performance and an automated solution for efficiency.
- **Preoperative and Postoperative Evaluation**: Ideal for assessing changes and planning surgeries.

## Requirements
- **iPhone with FaceID**: The protocol requires an iPhone with a front-facing FaceID scanner. Compatible models include:
  - iPhone X or later
- **ScandyPro App**: Recommended for obtaining high-quality facial scans[^3^][9][^4^][10].
- **Scan Positioning**: Ensure scans are centered on the nose to prevent arc drift and maintain feature accuracy.

## Saving Scans
- **File Format**: Save the facial scans as `.ply` files to retain vertex and color information when uploading to Blender[^5^][7].

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have a compatible iPhone model with the ScandyPro app installed.
2. Follow the protocol to capture a facial scan, centering on the nose.
3. Save the scan as a `.ply` file.
4. Import the `.ply` file into Blender for simulation and analysis.

## Usage
Shadowgrams can be used to quickly assess facial asymmetries, such as nasal asymmetry, offering a superior alternative to anthropometrics and photogrammetry. The detailed process and best practices are outlined in the included documentation.
